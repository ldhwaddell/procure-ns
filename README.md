# procure-ns

This project tracks the ingestion, analytical transformation, and visualization of awarded Nova Scotia Government procurement tenders.

It is split into two parts. [www](https://github.com/ldhwaddell/procure-ns/tree/main/www) contains the empty folder for tracking development of the front-end visualization website. The ingestion and transformation of the raw data is stored and maintained in the [data](https://github.com/ldhwaddell/procure-ns/tree/main/data) folder.
